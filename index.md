### Redis

- Download the msi file. You can download alterantively the zip file but you will need to add manually environmental variables.
- Assuming that we are using the msi file, go over the typical installation wizard but do not forget to check the add to path variable.

- Let the port number and the add exception as it is and continue with the default values in the wizard

- In order to connect to the redis server open a cmd and type `redis-cli`. If everything is correct you will connect to your local instance and you will be able to start interacting with the redis server. You can try `SET key value` and it should return `OK` and then `GET key` to get the assigned value.
