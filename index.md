### Redis
Redis is a NO-SQL, key-value in-memory remote database that offers high performance, replication, and a unique data model. 

#### Windows
- Go to https://github.com/microsoftarchive/redis/releases/tag/win-3.0.504

- Download the msi file. You can download alterantively the zip file but you will need to add manually environmental variables.
- Assuming that we are using the msi file, go over the typical installation wizard but do not forget to check the add to path variable.

- Let the port number and the add exception as it is and continue with the default values in the wizard
- With msi installer the redis-server will automatically run in the background when the system starts

- In order to connect to the redis server open a cmd and type `redis-cli`. If everything is correct you will connect to your local instance and you will be able to start interacting with the redis server. You can try `SET key value` and it should return `OK` and then `GET key` to get the assigned value.

#### Linux


### Python

We will need Python > 3.5 version in order to build some simple CRUD applications and demonstrate how to use NoSQL data stores within applications.
Linux and Mac users should have both 2.7.x and > 3.6.x versions installed by default on their machines. You can check your current version for both of them with:

```
python --version
python3 --version
```

Windows users please go at https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/ and get the appropriate file for your PC. Please note that during the installation you will be asked to add Python in Path. You should enable this option. 

![alt text](/pythonpath.png)

It allows you to run your files on cmd by: 

```
python python_file.py
```

If you do not enable this you will be forced to use the full python path to execute your programs. (for example, it will be something like: 
c:/users/username/program files/python36/python pytthon_file.py )

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/karolosk/codehub_no_sql_software/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/karolosk/codehub_no_sql_software/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
